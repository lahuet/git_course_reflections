What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When I initialize a repository, it makes a .git file but does not make any commits.  I need to add files and then commit.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is the in-between for the working directory and repository.  Since the repository leaves permanent traces and the working directory changes so often, it helps to choose what we commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

I can use the staging area to add changes that only pertain to one logical change.
