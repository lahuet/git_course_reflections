When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I'd want to use a remote repository when I want to share and collaborate on code with others.  (Or as backup?)

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because I might have changes on the local I don't want the remote to interfere with.
